# BAMAZON

This is my homework project for the imaginary BAMAZON store where I am selling the most expensive band instruments I could find.
This project is useful because it demonstrates how to use mySql linked to node.js and the ridiculous amount of money some instruments can sell for.
Users can get started with project by typing CLI commands and following the prompts.
